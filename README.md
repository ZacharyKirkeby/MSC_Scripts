# MSC_Scripts

This is a collection of assorted bash/powershell scripts that I have written. These most definitely need to be modified to work for anyone elses system/OS. 


## Installer Script

This, as the name implies, installs stuff. This is meant for debian 10.0, and installs my usual starter tools onto an otherwise assumed to be fresh linux install. This should work on debian derivatives like Kali, though this may be redundant given kali's preinstalled tools.
